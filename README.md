# Description

This browser application allows users to view a framework for a website that will hold Michael Rao's portfolio works. A navigation bar allows users to jump to the portfolio section of the page that holds Lorem Ipsum descriptions of upcoming work. The nav bar also allows users to access Michael's GitHub, LinkedIn, and Twitter pages, as well as contact via email. Nab bar items highlight in gray when hovered over.

Additionally, the page contains a photo of Michael, visible on screens smaller than 768 pixels, and a video of Michael and his dog, visible on screens larger than 768 pixels.

In the main section of the page, there are placeholders for future portfolio projects. Placeholder decriptions of those projects are visible only at screen sizes above 768 pixels.

Finally, a footer shows the page copyright.
